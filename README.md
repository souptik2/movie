Description:

The Mule 4 Movie Details Viewer is a project that combines the power of MuleSoft's Mule 4 integration platform with a simple and user-friendly front-end interface. This project allows users to input a movie title of their choice, and it retrieves detailed information about that movie from the IMDb database API.

Features:

1. User-Friendly Front-End: The project features a sleek and intuitive front-end designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can easily input the movie title they want to learn more about.

2. Mule 4 Integration: The core of the project is built using Mule 4, a robust integration platform. Mule 4 handles the communication between the front-end and IMDb API.

3. IMDb Database API Integration: When a user submits a movie title, the project sends a request to the IMDb database API, fetching detailed information about the movie, including its title, year of release, 
   plot summary, cast, and more.

4. Cache Strategy: To optimize performance and minimize unnecessary API calls, the project implements a cache strategy. It stores previously retrieved movie details for a specific period, reducing the load on 
   the IMDb API and improving response times.

5. Resilient Error Handling: The project includes error-handling mechanisms to ensure a graceful response in case of any unexpected issues during data retrieval.

1. For developers and MuleSoft enthusiasts, this project serves as a practical example of implementing Mule 4 for integration purposes.
2. For movie enthusiasts, it provides a convenient way to fetch detailed information about their favorite films from IMDb.
